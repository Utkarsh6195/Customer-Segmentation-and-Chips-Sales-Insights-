## Customer Segmentation and Trial Store Performance Analysis
### ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
- This repository showcases my end-to-end data analytics project work using Python for in-depth data analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The project focuses on Customer Segmentation, Product Analysis, and Trial Store Performance Evaluation, culminating in actionable business insights.

### Task 1: Customer Segmentation and Chips Sales Insights
In this task, I analyzed transactional data to uncover customer behaviors and preferences for strategic decision-making.

Key Contributions:

- Data Preparation:
Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python for accurate analysis.
Engineered features like PROD_SIZE and customer-level metrics.
- Analysis and Insights:
Identified high-value customer segments such as Older Families and Premium Customers.
Highlighted product performance trends by analyzing brand and package size preferences.
- Interactive Power BI Dashboard:
Built a 4-page dashboard for clear and actionable insights:
Customer Segmentation and Product Analysis: Sales distribution by customer type and product performance.
- Customer Insights: Average spend analysis and transaction trends.
Sales Trends: Yearly and monthly sales trends to identify seasonality.
Findings and Insights: Key takeaways and recommendations for business strategies.

###Task 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation
This task focused on evaluating the impact of trial layouts in selected stores.

Key Contributions:

- Control Store Selection:
Used Pearson correlation and magnitude distance to select control stores for comparison.
- Performance Metrics:
Analyzed metrics like total sales, customer counts, and transactions per customer during the pre-trial and trial periods.
- Statistical Analysis:
Conducted hypothesis testing to determine whether differences between trial and control stores were significant.
- Insights and Recommendations:
Trial layouts effectively increased customer numbers, with Store 88 showing the best results.
Proposed layout refinements for scalability across other stores.
